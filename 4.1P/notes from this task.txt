using enum
- rather than my traditional method of defining enum in an array, this can be done through the enum declaration.
- it does not directly reference the class, however, you can make decisions on classed based off the enum value.
- for example, in this task we initialise an enum called shapeSelected with circle and rectangle at 0 and 1 respectively. The integer assignment is automatic
- Then, when we press c, this assigns a shape variable as a circle shape

Child : Parent Class.
