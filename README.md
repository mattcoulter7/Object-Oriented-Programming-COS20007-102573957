# Object Oriented Programming
This unit was about learning the core concepts of Object Oriented programming (abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism)

My final for this unit was the development of a Traffic Intersection Simulator. The report for the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-6_QMUZGuX-VyO6G5A-N8ZGVSvmeHaW6/view?usp=sharing)
